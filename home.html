<h1>Welcome to CS 1030</h1>

<p class="tag">Let's take a brief journey through the things we've learned and will learn</p>

<h2>1. Intro to Python</h2>

<p class="pypar">Ah python... a rite of passage for so many CS students and hobby-coders alike.  
One of our first introductions to coding languages was Python.  Here, we'll learn
some of the more simple features like the print() function, the difference between
strings, floats, and ints, and variables.  The very stuff you use to impress your 
non-CS friends.</p>

talking about a snake</a>

<h2>2. Intro to Networking Systems and Cybersecurity</h2>

<p>Now back it up!  What's code got to do with it, do with it?  What's code but a 
second-hand .... product of NETWORKS! Well, kinda at least.  Here we touched on the basics
of how networks work, how computer systems can send, store, and modify data and programs, and
the different types of options for cloud-based servers. A very important piece of the puzzle.</p>

memorable cybersecurity breaches in history</a>

<h2>3. Intro to HTML and CSS</h2>

<p>This is where we are now!  This very website is brought to you by none other than the 
lessons in module 6: HTML and CSS-- quite possibly the most debated of all programming 
languages, because, well, is it really even a language? I'll let you decide that much.</p>

The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  The second shows the text bubble coming from the apple in the tree:
HTML is a programming language.  The third photo shows the tree swinging backwards.  The fourth image shows 
the tree hurling the apple very, very far from the tree."  height="550px" width="475px">
